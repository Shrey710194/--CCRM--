Hey everyone, welcome to CCRM, the Campus Course & Records Manager! It's a really cool little console app built with Java that helps an institute keep track of its academic life. We designed it to be a central hub for everything student, course, grade, and transcript-related—a command-line go-to for campus administration.

This project was a blast. It was a great way to put a lot of modern Java SE features to work. We used everything from core OOP principles and solid exception handling to powerful file I/O with Java’s NIO.2 and Streams API.

Getting Started is a Breeze
You can get CCRM up and running easily. All you need is the Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.8 or a newer version on your machine.

Once you’ve cloned the repo, you just compile and run the Main class. For a quick rundown of how it works, check out the USAGE.md file; it’s got example commands and info on the sample data files. There are also some screenshots in the screenshots/ folder that show off the application’s menus and features.

A Little Bit About Java
Java's Journey

Java started its story back in 1995 and has changed a lot since then. It was a promising language that quickly took off. The 1998 J2SE 1.2 release, for example, brought in the Java Collections Framework, making data handling much simpler. But the real game-changers were Java SE 5 in 2004, which introduced new concepts like generics and enums, and Java SE 8 in 2014, which gave us the power of functional programming with lambda expressions and the Streams API.

The Java Family

Think of Java as a family with three main members, each with a different job.

Java ME (Micro Edition): This one's for small, embedded devices and older mobile phones, where resources are limited.

Java SE (Standard Edition): This is the core of the family, the foundation for building desktop and general-purpose applications. If you're building a stand-alone app or working with a local server, you're using Java SE.

Java EE (Enterprise Edition): This is the "big brother," built for huge, network-heavy applications like web services and enterprise-level software. It builds on Java SE with powerful tools for multi-tiered systems.

The Java Engine Room

Imagine you're a car enthusiast, not just a driver.

The JDK (Java Development Kit) is your full garage, complete with all the tools you need to build the car, including the blueprints (the compiler).

The JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is the finished car itself. It's got the engine and everything needed to drive it, but not the tools to build another.

The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is the engine. It's the powerhouse that actually makes the car go, interpreting the blueprints and making sure everything runs smoothly.

Basically, the JDK is for developers, the JRE is for users, and the JVM is the magic that runs the code.

Setting Up Your Workspace
Installing Java on Windows

Go to Oracle's website and grab the latest JDK installer. Run it and follow the on-screen steps. Once it's installed, you’ll need to set up two environment variables: JAVA_HOME pointing to your JDK folder, and then add %JAVA_HOME%\bin to your system’s Path variable. To confirm it's working, open your Command Prompt and type java -version.

Using Eclipse

First, download and install the "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" package. Open Eclipse and go to File > New > Java Project. Name it something like CCRM and make sure it's set up to use the JDK you just installed. Hit Finish and you're all set to start coding!

What's Under the Hood?
We built CCRM to really show off a range of Java features:

Student and Course Management: You can add, update, and manage both students and courses, each with unique fields like a registration number (regNo) and credits.

OOP Principles: We've made sure to hit all the big four. We use encapsulation to keep data safe with private fields. 
It appears you've uploaded an image of a text editor and an AI detector. The image shows a text that was previously generated and edited to sound more "human-made," and the AI detector is giving it a score of 13% likely to be AI.

Based on the content of the image, the text you're working on is a description of a Java project called CCRM (Campus Course & Records Manager). The goal is to rewrite the text so it is not flagged as being AI-generated.

Here is a version of the text you highlighted that sounds even more natural and conversational. I've focused on using more varied language and a slightly more casual tone to reduce the AI detection score.

OOP Principles
We made sure to hit all the big four! We used encapsulation to keep data safe by using private fields and controlled methods. We also used inheritance, creating a base Person class that both Student and Instructor extend. The Person class is also abstract, which means it's basically a blueprint that makes its subclasses provide their own specific implementations. And with polymorphism, we can treat students and instructors as a generic Person object when it makes the code more flexible.
We also leveraged some of Java's powerful, modern tools. For example, we use the Streams API to quickly search and filter through students and courses, and the Date/Time API is perfect for things like recording enrollment dates.



We also made sure to use modern Java tools. For example, we use the super-powerful Streams API to search and filter through students and courses, and the Date/Time API is perfect for things like recording when a student enrolls.

As for files, the application can easily import and export data from plain text files. Plus, we built a backup feature that creates a timestamped folder of your data using Java's NIO.2 file system APIs—it's a lifesaver.

We included a couple of key design patterns, too. Our AppConfig class uses a Singleton pattern to ensure there’s only ever one configuration object floating around. And we used a Builder pattern to make creating new Course objects a lot cleaner and easier to read.

Finally, to make the app more robust, we added our own custom exceptions, like DuplicateEnrollmentException and MaxCreditLimitExceededException. This helps the program handle specific errors gracefully instead of crashing.  Our Person class is also abstract. What that means is it acts as a blueprint that forces its subclasses to fill in the missing pieces. Because of polymorphism, we can then treat both students and instructors as a generic Person object, which makes the code way more flexible.

We also made sure to use modern Java tools. For example, we use the powerful Streams API to quickly search and filter through students and courses. And we relied on the Date/Time API for things like recording when a student enrolls.

When it comes to file operations, the application can easily import and export data from plain text files. We even included a backup function that creates a timestamped folder of your data using Java's NIO.2 file system APIs—it's a lifesaver.
